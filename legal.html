<h2>Legal Help</h2>
<p> We know it can be bothersome and confusing to find out the legality of different things when it comes to buying your first guns, so we've done some of it for you. Even though Nebraska is pretty lax in it's laws, you don't want to break them on accident! We found different pieces of information in hopes that it will help you decide your purchases.</p>


<h3>Purchaseing a Gun</h3>
<p>You will be required to fill out a <a href="https://www.lancaster.ne.gov/375/Firearm-Purchase-Permit">Firearms Purchase Permit</a> to buy, lease, rent, or receive a handgun. There is not a permit that you need to have for purchasing a rifle or shotgun.</p>


<h3>Concealed Carrys</h3>
<p>As of September 2, 2023, a Concealed Handgun Permit is no longer required in order to carry a concealed handgun in the State of Nebraska. As long as you are 21+ and not prohibited by the law otherwise, you can purchase and carry a handgun. You can find more information <a href="https://statepatrol.nebraska.gov/services/concealed-handgun-permits/nebraska-reciprocity?utm_source=chatgpt.com">here</a>. </p>


<h3>Do Your Research</h3>
<p>Laws can be confusing, but they're there for a reason. Make sure to verify the laws when it comes to other states since they can vary by quite a bit. Also make sure you are following laws in related fields like hunting. </p>
