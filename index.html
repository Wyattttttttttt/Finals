<h2>About Us</h2>
	<p> We are a store built on values, and we want to keep gun hobbys affordable while feeding our families. If you want affordable prices with good quality, please consider us! Here's a description of what we offer for a few common reasons to buy a gun.</p>

<h3>Hunting </h3>
	<p>We offer a variety of weapons for use in hunting, as well as gear to maintain your weapons. We sell rifles, shotguns, bows, and all the ammunition for each of those. We offer some tools like binoculars, camoflage outfits, knives, and a few different size scopes.</p>

<h3>Self Defense</h3>
	<p>They say an armed society is a polite society! We offer a variety of handguns, but we also want to offer more to people who don't want a gun, but want something to defend themselves with. We offer tasers, pepper spray, stun guns, and more.</p>
